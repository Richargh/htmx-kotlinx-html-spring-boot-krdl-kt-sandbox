== LiveReload / Restart

LiveReload is great for fast iteration. It'll restart spring and refresh your browser window for changes.

To use it:

. Make sure you have the link:https://github.com/livereload/livereload-extensions[LiveReload extension] installed in Firefox/Chrome
. Run your application via `./gradlew bootRun` and open the site in your browser
. Trigger a rebuild in IntelliJ `CMD + F9`
. Your browser should refresh after Spring has restarted
